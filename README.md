# Short-read and long-read RNA sequencing of mouse hematopoietic stem cells at bulk and single-cell levels 
# Abstract
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) lie at the top of the differentiation hierarchy. Although HSC and their immediate downstream, multipotent progenitors (MPP) have full multilineage differentiation capacity, only long-term (LT-) HSC have the capacity for long term self-renewal. The heterogeneity within the HSC population is more and more acknowledged with single-cell RNA sequencing and lineage tracing technologies. Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations play important roles in controlling the differentiation and self-renewal capacity within HSC population. Here we report two datasets comprising single-cell and bulk short- and long-read RNA sequencing for long- and short-term HSC and MPP isolated from mouse bone marrows. These datasets provide a groundwork for comprehensive and comparative studies on gene expression and unique alternative splicing events occur in these 3 populations while exploring the heterogeneity within all three populations.
